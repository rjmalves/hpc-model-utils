# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## The 2.x series

2.0.0 is the drop-in v2 engine, with the status-semantics change described in [`docs/notices/v2-status-semantics.md`](docs/notices/v2-status-semantics.md). 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 carry the versioned workflow definitions and the relay fixes that the NEWAVE and DECOMP workflows run. 2.1.0 adds cobre. The next release tightens the DECOMP FC stage check ([`docs/notices/v2-fc-stage-mismatch.md`](docs/notices/v2-fc-stage-mismatch.md)), cleans the logs and adds a cobre results dashboard.

## [Unreleased]

### Behavior changes

- A chained DECOMP run whose dadger `FC NEWCUT` names a `cortes-NNN.dat` other than the stage its horizon end needs now fails in `preprocess` with `DATA_ERROR` (`SetDataError`) before any job is submitted; 2.0.0 to 2.1.0 only appended the mismatch to the annotation. See [`docs/notices/v2-fc-stage-mismatch.md`](docs/notices/v2-fc-stage-mismatch.md).
- The synthesis step's failure messages name the tool neutrally for every model: a failed step reads `synthesis failed: synthesis tool exited <n>` instead of `synthesis failed: sintetizador exited <n>`, and a missing binary reads `synthesis tool binary not found; tried: …`, with `; pass --synthesis-bin` when the option was not given; the `synthesis failed:` prefix, the statuses, the rule ids and `synthesis_status` are unchanged.
- A successful cobre run with a simulation phase now runs the synthesis step, so a direct `run cobre` outside ModelOps needs `--synthesis-bin` pointing at cobre-bridge; without it the run ends `RUNTIME_ERROR` (`core.synthesis_missing`), as NEWAVE and DECOMP already do without a sintetizador.

### Changed

- Relayed job-log lines and the sintetizador, nwlistcf and nwlistop output are written verbatim, without the CLI's timestamp and logger prefix, and `LOGLEVEL` no longer filters them.
- The finalize job log keeps only sintetizador's WARNING-or-above lines and a one-line summary; the full output is in `saidas/logs/synthesis.out`.
- A typed error (`DataError`, `UsageError`, …) on a command's fatal path is logged as one `<command> failed: <category>: <message>` line instead of a traceback; unexpected exceptions keep the traceback.
- `deploy/modelops/check_relay.py` reads the verbatim relay and still reads the prefixed relay of 2.0.x and 2.1.0 runs.
- `ModelPlugin.synthesis_args` takes the workspace as its first argument (`synthesis_args(ws, cpus)`); NEWAVE and DECOMP behavior is unchanged.
- `deploy/modelops/apply.py` verifies the cobre workflow's synthesis pin against the cobre-bridge repository.

### Added

- `saidas/logs/synthesis.out`: sintetizador's complete output.
- `docs/architecture.md` and a README rewritten for v2.
- `docs/notices/v2-fc-stage-mismatch.md`.
- `deploy/modelops/workflows/cobre.json`: the `cobre` workflow, with its own `cobre-run` and `ensure-utils` Tasks.
- `deploy/modelops/tasks/`: the seven shared Tasks (`create-workdir`, `remove-workdir`, `fetch-executables`, `fetch-inputs`, `extract-sanitize`, `result-upload` and `cancel-run`) accept the model `cobre`.
- `deploy/modelops/workflows/upload-versao.json`: `Upload Versão` offers the model `cobre` and runs upload-versoes-cli 1.1.0.
- `docs/runbooks/cobre-rollout.md`: the runbook that applies the cobre definitions to ModelOps and validates cobre on the cluster.
- cobre builds `sintese/dashboard.html` with `cobre-bridge dashboard` after a successful run with a simulation phase; a dashboard failure keeps `SUCCESS` and is recorded in the annotation and in `synthesis_status`.
- `deploy/modelops/tasks/ensure-utils.sh` installs cobre-bridge 0.17.0 beside hpc-model-utils, and `deploy/modelops/tasks/cobre-run.sh` passes it to `run` as `--synthesis-bin`.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-10-05

NEWAVE and DECOMP behavior is unchanged from 2.0.2.

### Added

- The cobre model plugin: `hpc-model-utils <command> cobre` runs native cobre case zips (with or without a top-level folder) with the MPI build `cobre-mpi` only, on one or several nodes, through `srun --mpi=pmix` with one rank per node and `--comm-backend mpi`; `check_and_fetch_executables` checks `cobre-mpi` statically (a regular, owner-executable ELF file) and never runs it.
- `run cobre` requires `--max-cores-per-node`: threads per node T = max_cores_per_node and nodes K = cores / T, and cores must be a multiple of T.
- The cobre outcome mapping: a run whose model log never shows cobre-mpi's `Backend:   MPI` line is `RUNTIME_ERROR`; otherwise exits 1 and 2 are `DATA_ERROR` and exits 3 and 4 are `RUNTIME_ERROR`; a run that exits 0 is `SUCCESS` only when every enabled phase wrote its metadata, training completed, and every simulation scenario completed; never `INFEASIBLE`.
- cobre artifacts: `saidas/training.zip`, `saidas/policy.zip`, `saidas/simulation.zip` and the raw `saidas/training/metadata.json` and `saidas/simulation/metadata.json`; no sintetizador step.
- The platform-identifier set covers the `maxCoresPerNode` workflow parameter.
- `deploy/modelops/workflows/ranqueamento.json` and `deploy/modelops/workflows/upload-versao.json`: the `Ranqueamento Prospectivo` and `Upload Versão` workflows are now managed under `deploy/modelops/` and use the v2 shared Tasks.
- `docs/runbooks/v2-switch.md`: the operator procedure that switches the original workflows to the v2 definitions, with its rollback.
- `docs/runbooks/v2-sweep.md`: the operator procedure that moves the shared Tasks onto the v2 set.

### Changed

- `deploy/modelops/workflows/`: `NEWAVE - PEM`, `DECOMP - PEM` and `Upload NEWAVE` now use the v2 Tasks, and the `[v2]` workflow copies are removed.
- `docs/notices/v2-status-semantics.md`: names the workflows that switch to v2 (v2.0.2 or later) and adds a checklist for encadeador developers.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- The job-log relay no longer loses the output of a job that ends before its log file becomes visible on the login node (NFS negative-lookup caching); a log that never appears is reported with an explicit `[hpcmu] log never appeared` marker.

### Added

- `HPCMU_MISSING_LOG_GRACE`: how long the relay keeps looking for a job log it never saw, after the job leaves the queue (default 90 s).
- `deploy/modelops/workflows/*-v2.json`: the `NEWAVE - PEM [v2]`, `DECOMP - PEM [v2]` and `Upload NEWAVE [v2]` workflow copies, for validating v2 beside the original workflows.
- `docs/runbooks/v2-pre-rollout.md`: the validation runbook for the `[v2]` copies, run before the original workflows switch to v2.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- The stdout neutralizer also defangs the `HPCMU_TOOL` phrase, so relayed text cannot rewrite the tool-path parameters of the versioned workflow definitions.
- The platform-identifier set covers the four parameters the versioned workflow definitions add (`utilsAppSha`, `synthesisAppSha`, `utilsToolDir`, `synthesisToolDir`).

### Added

- `deploy/modelops/`: templated ModelOps Task and Workflow definitions, with a structural publication lint.
- `deploy/modelops/scripts/ensure-tools.sh`: immutable per-commit tool installs on an exact-patch shared interpreter.
- A read-only definitions snapshot command (`python -m deploy.modelops.apply snapshot`).
- `deploy/modelops/apply.py`: `python -m deploy.modelops.apply sync` prints a read-only dry-run diff of the definitions against ModelOps.
- `deploy/modelops/apply.py`: `python -m deploy.modelops.apply sync --apply` is the only write path, and it writes only from a clean working tree after a typed confirmation.
- `deploy/modelops/check_relay.py`: a relay-completeness checker that compares a run's relayed output with its job logs and reports the first lost, extra or changed line.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-03

### Behavior changes

- DECOMP max iterations (no convergence) now calls `SetRuntimeError` instead of `SetModelError`.
- DECOMP negative optimality gap now calls `SetRuntimeError` instead of `SetModelError`.
- A crashed DECOMP run, or one missing `relato`, now calls `SetRuntimeError` instead of `SetModelError`.
- A NEWAVE full run whose final simulation lacks the simulated-series cost table now calls `SetRuntimeError` instead of `SetSuccess`.
- A NEWAVE run with no `pmo.dat` now calls `SetRuntimeError`, where v1 called `SetDataError`
  (or `SetSuccess` for a consistency run).
- A job ended by timeout, node failure, licence failure or cancellation now calls `SetRuntimeError` (`TIMEOUT`/`INFRA_ERROR`/`LICENSE_ERROR`/`CANCELLED`) instead of depending on incidental output parsing.
- A successful run whose sintetizador or postprocess step failed still calls `SetSuccess`, but the reason is now prefixed `synthesis failed:`/`postprocess failed:` and `synthesis_status=failed` is recorded.
- A successful run with a missing sintetizador now calls `SetRuntimeError` (`core.synthesis_missing`) instead of `SetSuccess`.
- See [`docs/notices/v2-status-semantics.md`](docs/notices/v2-status-semantics.md) for the full comparison and the operator delivery checklist.

### Added

- The v2 `hpc_model_utils` engine with typed run state (`.hpcmu/state.json`).
- Kebab-case command aliases.
- `saidas/run.json`.
- Per-phase job logs under `saidas/logs/`.
- `saidas/relgnl.<ext>` for DECOMP.
- `run --synthesis-bin`.
- `HPCMU_*` engine tunables.
- Signal-driven cancellation of submitted jobs.

### Changed

- The `hpc-model-utils` console script now runs `hpc_model_utils.cli:main`.
- A missing sintetizador on a successful run is an annotated `RUNTIME_ERROR`.
- `botocore` and `cfinterface` are now declared direct dependencies.
- Production workflows adopt 2.0.0 only after a pre-rollout validation of the new workflow copies; until then they keep their current pins.

### Removed

- DESSEM and GEVAZP.
- The `output_compression_and_cleanup`, `download_executed_run` and `fetch_extract_raw_outputs` commands.
- `assets/jobs/*`.
- The `idessem` and `pytz` dependencies.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- Offline-ingested NEWAVE runs no longer execute the full model. `run` now reads the `execution_source = OFFLINE` flag recorded by `ingest_offline_run` and submits only the post job (status → postprocess → compression), so an offline run driven by the external scheduler skips model execution without requiring an explicit `--skip` flag. The `--skip` flag remains available as an override.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added insurance to avoid resource scarcity while creating new threads in `newave_post.job` and `decomp_post.job`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- `ingest_offline_run` command (NEWAVE): ingests a run executed offline (outside the cluster) from three explicit S3 object keys — the inputs, outputs and Benders-cuts archives. The archives may arrive under arbitrary names, so ingestion does not depend on archive names: it downloads all three, extracts them together into the working directory, standardizes filenames and encoding, rebuilds the raw input-deck echo (`eco_deck.zip`) from the deck contents, points the process manager at the executables directory, and records study metadata. This lets an offline run flow through the same downstream steps (`generate_execution_status` → `postprocess` → `output_compression_and_cleanup` → `result_upload`) via `run --skip`, as if it had executed on the cluster.
- Offline runs are marked with an `execution_source = OFFLINE` metadata flag and a ModelOps annotation so they remain distinguishable from cluster executions.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- Added `qprevs-medio-usina.csv` to the list of NEWAVE files to be processed into `relatorios.zip`

## [1.0.5] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Collect `deco_*.msg` files as DECOMP report outputs (were previously excluded from the uploaded outputs)

### Changed

- Bump dependencies to their latest releases: `boto3` 1.43, `click` 8.4, `idecomp` 1.10, `idessem` 1.2, `inewave` 1.13, `boto3-stubs` 1.43, `mypy` 2.1, `pytest-cov` 7.1, `pytest-timeout` 2.4, `requests` 2.34, `ruff` 0.15 (plus refreshed transitive dependencies in `uv.lock`)

## [1.0.4] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Cap CPU count for `SYNTHESIS_APP` calls (at physical cores via `lscpu`) and `output_compression_and_cleanup` (at vCPUs via `nproc`) in `newave_post.job` and `decomp_post.job` to avoid resource over-subscription on HPC hosts
- Add missing `--processadores` flag to `decomp_post.job` synthesis call so it explicitly limits parallelism

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Add support to DECOMP license filename `decomp_trial.cep`

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- Model version extraction in `check_and_fetch_executables` across all models (NEWAVE, DECOMP, DESSEM, GEVAZP) — was registering empty values due to path ending in '/'

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- Model version extraction in `check_and_fetch_executables` across all models (NEWAVE, DECOMP, DESSEM, GEVAZP) — was registering model name instead of version due to wrong split index
- Unit tests for NEWAVE and DECOMP repositories updated to match v1.0.0 API signatures (S3 path-based interface)
- Removed obsolete test references to deleted `generate_unique_input_id` method and renamed constants
- Fixed test mocks for `run` (mocking `submit_job`/`follow_submitted_job` directly instead of low-level terminal calls)
- Marked `test_uploads_empty_file` integration test as `xfail` due to LocalStack 3.0 bug with empty PutObject

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- Input validation layer with fail-fast semantics for all CLI commands
- Structured error hierarchy (`CLIError`, `ValidationError`, `SlurmError`, `S3Error`, `ModelError`) with distinct exit codes
- SLURM job monitoring redesign with `sacct` fallback for fast-finishing jobs
- Command timing decorator for observability
- Custom Click parameter types (`ModelNameType`, `S3PathType`, `PositiveIntType`)
- Per-command input validators
- Comprehensive unit test suite (validation, error handling, SLURM monitoring, Click types)
- S3 integration tests with LocalStack
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions (unit tests, type checking, linting, integration tests)
- Professional packaging with `pyproject.toml` and `hatchling` build backend
- Installation script (`setup.sh`) with automatic PATH symlink

### Models

- **NEWAVE**: Full workflow support — input parsing (inewave), status diagnosis from `pmo.dat`, postprocessing with `nwlistcf`/`nwlistop`, parallel output compression
- **DECOMP**: Full workflow support — input parsing (idecomp), status diagnosis from `relato`/`inviab_unic`, parent NEWAVE metadata handling
