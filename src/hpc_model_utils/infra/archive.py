"""infra.archive: stdlib-only safe zip adapter.

ADR-028 and the security brief require every member to be validated
before any extraction happens, so an unsafe archive fails loudly instead
of being half-extracted. ADR-040 and ADR-038 require streamed members
(never read whole into memory), Zip64 always on, flat decks with no
basename collisions, and tree archives whose members are POSIX paths
relative to a declared root that can never escape it.

Partial-archive policy: ``write_flat`` and ``write_tree`` validate every
member first -- for ``write_flat`` that includes the whole basename
collision table, for ``write_tree`` the root-escape check -- before
opening any zip file, so a validation failure never creates a file on
disk. Once validation has passed, the archive is built at a sibling
temporary path, ``archive.with_name("." + archive.name + ".part")``,
and only ``os.replace``'d onto ``archive`` after every member has been
written successfully; on any exception the partial file is unlinked.
``archive`` is therefore always either absent/unchanged or a complete,
valid zip, never a half-written one.

ADR-040's parallelism clause, amended by ticket-048b (``design/
amendments.md`` AM-003): members are compressed in parallel, up to
``workers`` threads per archive, each one streaming its member through
raw deflate into a scratch file under the archive's own directory --
never reading a member whole, so memory stays O(workers x 1 MiB). The
calling thread alone appends compressed members to the ``ZipFile``, in
input order, once a member's compression finishes. The scratch
directory is removed, and any ``.part`` file unlinked, on every
``BaseException``.
