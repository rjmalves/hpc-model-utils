"""R39/R11/R96/R29/R101/ADR-020/ADR-006: the ``run`` submission step.

``submit`` posts the model job, then the finalize job with
``--dependency=afterany:<model>`` (R39), in that printed order
(ADR-020): the platform's last-match ``jobId`` scrape therefore picks
up the finalize id. Each sbatch call and the matching
``JobLedger.add`` run inside one ``blocked_signals()`` critical
section, so a signal arriving between sbatch returning and the id
being recorded can never lose that id -- D2 (ticket-043) reads the
ledger for exactly this reason.

An offline-ingested run (``execution_source=OFFLINE``) and an
explicit ``--skip`` both submit finalize only, with no dependency
(R96); ``--skip`` is logged as the reason even when both are true,
since it is the caller's own explicit override.

A finalize-submit failure after the model job is already live leaves
that id only in the in-memory ``ledger`` -- by design (R29): there is
one ``store.save``, at the very end, so a failure here leaves
``state.json`` untouched. The orphaned model job stays recoverable
through the ``Submitted batch job <model>`` line already printed to
the platform, through ``cancel_run --job-id``, and later through the
in-process signal handlers (ticket-043); nothing further is needed
here.
