"""ADR-038/ADR-040/R78/R116: the cobre ``OutputPlan`` (ticket-071).

Each phase archive keeps the Hive layout: members are named relative to
``output/`` through a ``Tree`` layout, because Hive members share
basenames (``part-0000.parquet``) and a ``Flat`` layout would reject
them. A phase that did not run has no directory, so it gets no archive
and no raw file. ``output/stochastic/`` and ``output/hydro_models/``
(opt-in exports) have no archive in ADR-038 and are never uploaded.
